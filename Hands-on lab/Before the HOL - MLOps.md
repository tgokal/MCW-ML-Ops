# MLOps before the hands-on lab setup guide

## Requirements

1. Azure subscription. You will need a valid and active Azure account to complete the quickstarts. If you do not have one, you can sign up for a [free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).

   - The Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN.

   - Trial subscriptions will not work. You will run into issues with Azure resource quota limits.

   - Subscriptions with access limited to a single resource group will not work. You will need the ability to deploy multiple resource groups.

2. Azure DevOps subscription. You will need a valid and active Azure DevOps account to complete the quickstarts. If you do not have one, you can sign up for a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/).

   > **Note**: You will need privileges to create projects on the DevOps account. Also, you need privileges to create Service Principal in the tenet. This translates to **Ensure that the user has 'Owner' or 'User Access Administrator' permissions on the Subscription**.

3. Azure Machine Learning service workspace. An Azure Machine Learning workspace is a foundational resource in the cloud that you use to experiment, train, and deploy machine learning models. It ties your Azure subscription and resource group to an easily consumed object in the service.

4. Azure Machine Learning compute instance. The compute instance is created during Exercise 1 from the hands-on lab. It used as your fully configured and managed development environment in the cloud to run the quickstart integrated notebooks uploaded in your workspace file share.

## Before the hands-on lab

### Task 1: Create an Azure Machine Learning workspace

1. Sign in to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) by using the credentials for your Azure subscription.

2. In the upper-left corner of Azure portal, select **+ Create a resource**.

3. Use the search bar to find the **Machine Learning**.

4. Select **Machine Learning**.

5. In the **Machine Learning** pane, select **Create** to begin.

6. Provide the following information to configure your new workspace:

   - **Workspace name**: Enter a unique name that identifies your workspace. In this example, we use **quick-start-ws**. Names must be unique across the resource group. Use a name that's easy to recall and to differentiate from workspaces created by others.

   - **Subscription**: Select the Azure subscription that you want to use.

   - **Resource group**: Use an existing resource group in your subscription or enter a name to create a new resource group. A resource group holds related resources for an Azure solution. In this example, we use **MCW-MLOps**.

   - **Location**: Select the location closest to your users and the data resources to create your workspace.

   - **Workspace edition**: **Basic**. The workspace type (Basic & Enterprise) determines the features to which you’ll have access and pricing. Exercises in this tutorial works on either Basic or Enterprise editions.

   ![The Machine Learning Create form is displayed populated with the aforementioned values. The Review + Create button is highlighted.](media/bhol-02.png 'Create Azure Machine Learning Workspace page')

7. After you are finished configuring the workspace, select **Review + Create**. Select **Create** after you review the fields you just entered.

    > **Note**: It can take several minutes to create your workspace in the cloud.

    When the process is finished, a deployment success message appears.

8. To view the new workspace, select **Go to resource**.

9. Navigate to the [Azure Machine Learning Studio](https://ml.azure.com) and select the workspace that you created or select **Launch now** under **Try the new Azure Machine Learning studio** in the **Overview** section of your Azure Machine Learning workspace.
